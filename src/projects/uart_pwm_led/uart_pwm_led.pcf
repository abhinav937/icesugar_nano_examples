# UART PWM LED Controller - Pin Constraints for iCESugar-nano
# ------------------------------------------------------------
# This file maps logical signals to physical FPGA pins for the UART PWM LED project.
# Compatible with iCESugar-nano board and iCELink USB CDC interface.

# Clock input (12 MHz from iCELink)
set_io CLK D1

# UART RX pin (connected to iCELink USB CDC)
set_io RX A3

# UART TX pin (loopback - connected to iCELink USB CDC)
set_io TX B3

# LED output (onboard LED)
set_io LED B6

# Notes:
# - clk: 12 MHz clock from iCELink USB CDC interface
# - RX: UART receive pin, connected to iCELink
# - LED: PWM output to onboard LED
# - Pin assignments based on iCESugar-nano schematic
